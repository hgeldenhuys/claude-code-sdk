So it's not just the change logs, but it's their official documentation that gets updated sometimes without telling the developer community. So we'll need to cache those in order to detect the deltas and we'll only use the markdown links. And then once that is established, we'll develop market plugins or marketplace plugins for each capability we'll require for Claudecodes development. Like hooks and slash commands and agent definitions and skills, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But it's fundamental that Claude in this project understands kind of the full breadth of Claude code development. I suspect we'll be breaking everything down using skills. So when we were working on hooks that might trigger, you know, a hook skill, for example. So take the links that I'm pasting. You can add more if there's more embedded in those docs and they make sense. Follow them, catalog them, index them, and then we'll start developing the skills. But we'll also need a command to detect deltas or diffs between what we cached and what is being updated in the web from time to time.\n\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents.md\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins.md\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills.md\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/output-styles.md\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide.md\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/headless.md\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp.md\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/troubleshooting.md\n\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/third-party-integrations.md\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/amazon-bedrock.md\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/network-config.md\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/llm-gateway.md\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings.md\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/terminal-config.md\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config.md\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory.md\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/statusline.md\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference.md\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/interactive-mode.md\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands.md\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/checkpointing.md\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md\nhttps://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference.md\nultrathink","wordCount":243,"charCount":2372,"hasQuestion":false,"hasCodeReference":false,"hasFileReference":true,"hasContext":false}

However I've looked more into it and I'm seeing something that looks like it could be a mistake on Anthropic's side. And I'm wondering if Claude Code may be subject to the same situation occasionally.\n\nThe key message sequence seems to be:\n\nAn assistant message with two content blocks in an atypical order (tool_use first, text second)\nThen a user message with the corresponding tool_result\nNote the assistant's own text content is BETWEEN the \"tool_use\" and the \"tool_result\" in the overall sequence. This seems to be the atypical order, as Claude most often will respond with (text first, tool_use second).\n\nHere's an excerpt from the messages that cause the problem for me:\n\n[\n    ... truncated ...\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"tool_result\",\n        \"tool_use_id\": \"toolu_01Ya9WAYPEZjkyjxcw8J2SxB\",\n        \"content\": \"Error: Failed to read directory /home. open /home: operation not permitted\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"toolu_01FGfUwSu2N7d8f1tAFh4snU\",\n        \"type\": \"tool_use\",\n        \"name\": \"ListDirectory\",\n        \"input\": {\n          \"path\": \".\"\n        }\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"I apologize for the confusion.
